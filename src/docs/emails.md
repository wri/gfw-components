GFW templates use <a href="https://www.sparkpost.com/features/email-templates/" target="_blank">Sparkpost templates</a> for transactional email notifications. These templates are managed as part of the RW API infrastructure. See <a href="https://github.com/resource-watch/api-infrastructure/tree/production/terraform/modules/email-templates" target="_blank">this link</a> for instructions on how to modify these templates.

NOTE: Outlook 2016 and older does not support border radius property resulting in buttons and data circles showing as squares or rectangles.
